<h2>You were promised stories about prostitutes</h2>
<h3>and I don't have any</p>
<p>However,</p>
<p>My ex-somethingorother deserves a mention. This woman was tits-up insane. She had my balls in a god damn vice for a fuckin' decade and then disappears entirely out of my life suddenly and without explanation only to appear on the internet doing unspeakable things to my friends behind my back.</p>
<p>I'm unsure of how to deal with this, other than tell the truth about it. This website will be my outlet while I finally recover.</p>
<p>I swear to God I've been such a cuck that I've had to figure this shit out by myself and it's a god damn mindfuck to realize how fucked up I've become as a result of it.</p>
<p>It was sick. An abusive relationship that only existed in practice and not in the way we would see things. It was without a premise other than friendship.</p>
<p>As beautiful as that actually is while disregarding my exaggerations, it was also quite damaging to the two of us. I enforced her control, and she enforced my submission.</p>
<p>We were smart. We were sharp at the tongue. We were passionate. We were ambitious.</p>
<p>And we were bullied.</p>
<p>I guess she couldn't take it.</p>
<p>I intend to. I guess I'm there.</p>
<p>Some confessions would have been really helpful to our therapy.</p>
<p>But I know now; it was with a friend, and it was behind my back. You can't show up and say oops.</p>
<p>I hope you recover soon, my friend. I didn't mean to be as much of a victim as I have been.</p>
<p>I guess I'll never hear from you again.</p>
