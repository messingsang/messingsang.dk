<p>The works of God can be confusing and bewildering, offering no answers to be understood by ordinary thinking. A different state of mind is required to perceive the realm in which the gods operate. I sometimes take a dive, in order to get a taste of it.</p>

<p>I have a schizophrenia diagnosis. I have discovered for myself that the best way to deal with the schizophrenic condition is to harvest its ideas. I distance myself from this art, in the sense that it feels like the ideas themselves came not from within, but from an external source. This is also why I do not copyright my work.</p>

<p>I don't use drugs other than my dearest plants and my prescribed medication. What can I say my therapy/meditations have an entheogenic effect on me. That's the way I have taught myself to live.</p>

<p>It often feels like a blessing, but there is a drawback by the nature of contrast: <a href="javascript:void()" id="hiddenlink" title="In order to understand what not suffering is">I have to suffer.</a></p>

<p><i>Sample content</i></p>
<div class="ywn_container"><div class="ywn_narr">You were new to speaking with me. You had only recently discovered the possibility. You didn't know precisely what to ask something like me, so I did you the favor of leading the way with my question.</div>

<div class="ywn_red">Do you think that is grass you are stepping on?</div>

<div class="ywn_blue">Why? What else would it be?</div>

<div class="ywn_red">An idea I once had</div>

<div class="ywn_blue">How so?</div>

<div class="ywn_red">Grass is only a word</div>
  <div class="ywn_red">Perhaps you walk only on the meaning behind it.</div>

<div class="ywn_blue">I see</div>
  <div class="ywn_blue">Then what of concrete?</div>

<div class="ywn_red">What of it?</div>

<div class="ywn_blue">We humans made concrete, right? Is that an idea or something else entirely?</div>

<div class="ywn_red">It is. You created it.</div>
<div class="ywn_red">It does what you want it to.</div>

<div class="ywn_blue">I guess, but then, am I also like you, do I create what I see like a god?</div>

<div class="ywn_red">Yes. You, and I, and Luna are now the three gods of this universe.</div>

<div class="ywn_blue">Luna is my sister?</div>

<div class="ywn_red">In a way. Luna is the sister of mankind. You are a man.</div>

<div class="ywn_blue">Then am I dead? Or on drugs? Or is this a simulation?</div>

<div class="ywn_red">The experience you're having is inherently ambiguous; setting a premise for it would defeat the purpose.</div>

<div class="ywn_blue">That's difficult to comprehend. You mean I am talking to a god without knowing how?</div>

<div class="ywn_red">Yes, exactly. But I'll tell you why.</div>

<div class="ywn_blue">Why then?</div>

<div class="ywn_red">Because you're you</div>

</div>
