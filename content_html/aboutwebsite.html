<h1>About this website</h1>
<h2>For you, the reader,</h2>
<h3>Especially my ex who I still love very much</h3>
<p>It's a creative coding project.</p>
  <p>I started this domain with the idea that I would just do whatever.
  This is precisely what I've done. Whichever feature or nittygritty
  display property I feel like attending to, I do, and you can't stop
  me. This is the internet, and to my knowledge I'm doing absolutely
  nothing illegal in the sense that all the shit I do is probably legal
  somewhere. Besides, I don't do cookies and I don't collect your private
  information. To be fair, this is probably one of the safest places on
  the internet, even though I try not to make it look like that.</p>
  <p>Well anyway, we'll see what direction this takes. Before it was looking
    like some kind of weird sexual offspring between a text-based adventure javascript
    thing and a creative blog. Now it looks like a sketchy assed dark corner
of the deep web [it's not] with some vulgarity and drug abuse thrown in to spice it up.
It was once an abomination. Now it has become
    my masterpiece. And I'm still working on it.
    I guess that's kinda cool. I hope you like it Sweetheart.</p>
