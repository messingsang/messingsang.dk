<h1>About this website</h1>
<h2>Well, I can't say I'm not learning</h2>
<p>I started this domain with the idea that I would just do whatever.
  This is precisely what I've done. Whichever feature or nittygritty
  display property I feel like attending to, I do, and you can't stop
  me. This is the internet, and to my knowledge I'm doing absolutely
  nothing illegal in the sense that all the shit I do is probably legal
  somewhere. Besides, I don't do cookies and I don't collect your private
  information. To be fair, this is probably one of the safest places on
  the internet, even though I try not to make it look like that.</p>
  <p>Well anyway, we'll see what direction this takes. Right now it's looking
    like some kind of weird sexual offspring between a text-based adventure javascript
    thing and a personal blog. It was once an abomination. Now it has become
    my masterpiece. And I'm still working on it.
    I guess that's kinda cool. I hope you like it.</p>
