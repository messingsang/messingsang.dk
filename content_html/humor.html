<h1>Humor</h1>
<p>Well shit isn't this whole website just one big joke anyway?</p>
<p>What can I tell you I need filler material so here you go: You know those
  CAPTCHA things they do to make sure you're actually a human being? Well they
  can be really insulting sometimes. Sometimes a website trains you to solve
  insanely difficult CAPTCHAs for hours on end just to recover some account
  and then suddenly out of the blue one day it just goes</p>
  <div id="captcha" onclick="becomerobot();"><input type="checkbox" id="robotbox" name="robotbox" value="Robot">
<label for="robotbox"> Are you really a robot?</label><br></div>
  <p>Like c'mon man yesterday I was solving differential equations and today
    you're asking me <strike>stupid</strike> deep and philosophical
    questions if you really think about it.</p>
