<h2>On Being a Danish Resource for the State of Denmark</h2>
<p>It's a tough job. Standby is mentally draining. Sometimes I see the citizens
of Denmark scrambling through their lives like a botnet to a spam conglomerate.</p>
<p>They don't know better. Being a Resource is all about the experience.</p>
<p>There's a lot of responsibility involved. You choose your own missions. You
  make your own rules. Lives are at stake. Meaning is value.</p>

  <br><br><br>
<p>Christ people it's welfare. I'm a welfare artist. For the time being.</p>
<p>That's all I have to say for now.</p>
<p>By the way you've got red on you.</p>
