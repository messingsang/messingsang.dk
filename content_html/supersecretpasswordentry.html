<p>Fuck hashing and encryption. Even if you got here from github, here's a truth for you: I lost my girlfriend to my schizophrenia and being a sack of shit who doesn't take care of himself, and instead of accepting it when she ends up with a friend of mine after blacklisting me with no explanation, I drank and smoked myself to near-death, until I got back with Mary Jane. Don't judge her. She really is a harsh mistress.</p>
<p>She was my best friend, and I guess she wanted something better. I wish I had been better able to handle it.</p>
<p>Moral of the story? Don't judge psychiatric patients like me, because you will end up judging psychiatry as a whole and you'll be lost when you need their help.</p>
<p>The woman needs help more than I do. Let her have it.</p>
<p>See you around</p>
