<h1>Two attributes in life combined can guarantee a successful hero.</h1>
<p>The first one is persistence. The second is luck.</p>
<p>I guess you made it to some secret page or something.</p>
<p>I'm sorry but I haven't implemented this yet. Tell you what, since you managed to get to this message by either digging or actually checking out my website, I'll leave you a clue. On my social media I've left a message with a code I'll be using here.</p>
<p>You're welcome.</p>
<p>Actually, fuck hashing and encryption. Even if you got here from github, here's a truth for you: I lost my girlfriend to schizophrenia and being a sack of shit who doesn't take care of himself, and instead of accepting it when she ends up losing her virginity to/with a friend of mine, I drank and smoked myself to near-death, until I got back with Mary Jane. Don't judge her. She really is a harsh mistress.</p>
<p>See you around, hacker.</p>
