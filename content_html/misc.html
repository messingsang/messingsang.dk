<p><i>I had some dark shit in here until I replaced it. Here's something more uplifting for today.</i></p>

<p>I'm not a huge fan of dogma, but I do think there is something to be learned from every teaching, the Assumption of Mary as well. Understanding is key.</p>

<p>Let's propose the idea, and apologies if you are offended, that Mary, Jesus, and everyone involved in the Bible were in fact regular human beings who behaved as though they were just as human as us. These are holy icons, but we must be briefly iconoclastic for the sake of understanding the idea. Let's expand upon it. Mary gave birth to Jesus, but Mary was reportedly virgin (this is dogma), to which the inappropriate but common response is "huh?".</p>

<p>Imagine: That kind of factual improbability invites a lot of speculation. Surely people of the time (approx. 2000 years ago) understood she could not be virgin with a son. Suppose for a moment that speculation spiraled out of control. I suggest it is actually quite probable by the nature of humanity that the question of Mary's virginity was up for a lot of discussion not only behind closed doors, but also in the streets and taverns. Suppose this was in fact how Jesus Christ ended up crucified. What a lot of injustice.</p>

<p>If you think this is a load of crap you are welcome to. This is a proposition of an iconoclastic perspective to understanding the Assumption of Mary.</p>

<p>Think about it: How does a good person, which is to say a scholar of goodness within academia and church, help compensate for an injustice like that? The answer is heaven, and an immortalization of her name going on 2021 years and counting. It is a justification on behalf of the church.</p>
