<p>I was in a relationship once. I didn't know it was a relationship.</p>

<p>She was controlling me, and I didn't realize it.</p>

<p>I discovered her dominating behavior in the court of love.</p>

<p>It was a strange relationship. She would demand my friendship, and then deny it when offered.</p>

<p>I always figured I had done something wrong, and I improved myself. Primarily with obedience.</p>

<p>Her most intimate fantasies of me and her must have involved having sex with men, while I would sit by idly in awe of their work.</p>

<p>I loved her, truly and honestly.</p>

<p>But as it turns out I cannot be this person.</p>

<p>I am simply, and in all ways of understanding, simply too selfish.</p>
