<p>I was in a relationship once. I didn't know it was a relationship.</p>

<p>She was <strike>demanding and controlling of me</strike> grooming me to become a cuckold, and I didn't realize it. Nor did she.</p>

<p>I always thought I was the demanding and controlling one. I tried to improve. After all, I was the one seeing a psychiatrist. I don't think she liked that fact. She was brought up not to judge.</p>

<p>I discovered a perspective in a nightmare of mine in which I realized her dominating behavior in the court of love. She was ambitious, and I'm not much to look at.</p>

<p>It was a strange relationship. She would demand my friendship, and then deny it when offered.</p>

<p>I always figured I had done something wrong, and I improved myself. Primarily with obedience.</p>

<p>I imagine in my admittedly vivid nightmares that her most intimate fantasies of me and her must have involved having sex with men, while I would sit by idly in awe of their work.</p>

<p>I don't blame her for that. Not in the least. [You should see the porn I watch. We're animals.]</p>

<p>I loved her, truly and honestly.</p>

<p>I didn't give myself the respect I deserved. I continued loving her. Something happened, and she has refused to speak with me ever since.</p>

<p>Either I don't remember or I wasn't involved. Unconditional love is difficult when someone disappears.</p>

<p>As I remember her, she'd want me to be happy. I do my best.</p>

<p>But as it turns out I cannot be this person. Not by her standards.</p>

<p>I am simply, and in all ways of understanding, simply too selfish.</p>
<br><br><br>

<p>Always remember: Love is real. Love happens. Sometimes, it's behind your back.</p>
<p>You can take it.</p>
