<p><i>Please understand I have only recently understood and accepted I've been cucked. It will take some time before the story reflects reality, and she comes to terms with it as well.<br>

<p>I was in a relationship once. I didn't know it was a relationship.</p>

<p>She was <strike>demanding and controlling of me</strike> grooming me to become a cuckold, and I didn't realize it. Nor did she.</p>
<p>That's an exaggeration, but still. I loved the living shit out of the woman, and I have zero intention of ever stopping to love her.</p>
<p>She has my balls, and rightfully so.</p>

<p>I always thought I was the demanding and controlling one. I tried to improve. After all, I was the one seeing a psychiatrist. I don't think she liked that fact. She was brought up not to judge.</p>

<p>It must have been difficult for her to discover my schizophrenia, not to mention my masturbatory self-indulgent habits that most teenagers have.</p>

<p>It was a strange relationship.<strike> She would demand my friendship, and then deny it when offered.</strike></p>

<p>She was wonderful in every way. She was impossibly easy to trust and forgive for me.</p>

<p>I think we kinda liked that dynamic.</p>

<p>I was a flabbergastingly ignorant man of overwhelming idiocy with her. I always figured I had done something wrong, and I improved myself. Primarily with <strike>obedience</strike> avoidant behavior.</p>
<strike>
<p>I imagine in my admittedly vivid nightmares that her most intimate fantasies of me and her must have involved having sex with men, while I would sit by idly in awe of their work.</p>
</strike>
<p>Looking back, I realize it was a relationship, and still is to a degree. We both kept to ourselves.</p>

<strike><p>I don't blame her for that. Not in the least. [You should see the porn I watch. We're animals.]</p>
</strike>
<p>I love<strike>d</strike> her, truly and honestly.</p>
<strike>
<p>I didn't give myself the respect I deserved. I continued loving her. Something happened, and she has refused to speak with me ever since.</p>

<p>Either I don't remember or I wasn't involved. Unconditional love is difficult when someone disappears.</p>

<p>As I remember her, she'd want me to be happy. I do my best.</p>
</strike>

<p>I wanted to be her handsome knight on a white horse.</p>
<p>But as it turns out I cannot be this person. Not by my own standards.</p>

<p>I am simply, and in all ways of understanding, simply too selfish.</p>
<br><br><br>

<p>Always remember: Love is real. Love happens. Sometimes, we only realize it in retrospect.</p>
<p>You can take it.</p>
