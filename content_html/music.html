<p>Tube compressors are an annoying thing to model mathematically, which is one of the many reasons all my audio production sounds like absolute shit - I use digital compressors and I haven't a fucking clue what I'm doing other than make things sound louder by reducing the dynamic range on the fly. Being an amateur in the ways of sound production is frustrating in the sense that my amateurish guesswork will only sound like an unpleasant experience and make your head hurt. Either I sound like shit or it's not loud enough and it's never quite there.</p>

<p>I overcompress my audio and I'm aware of it. I won't post anything here until it's ready to sound like a pleasant listening experience.</p>

<p>It might take a while. I'm quite stubborn that way.</p>
