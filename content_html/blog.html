<h1>The Cannon</h1>
<p>Rune has a cannon. Well okay, he had his dad buy a cannon on an auction
  originally intended as a joke that turned into a paperwork mission for permission
  to handle salute weaponry. It's a small, but handy canon. You know, in case
  the castle gets invaded or something.</p>
  <p>To confuse the enemy, Rune enjoys inadvertently causing the canon to
    go boom instead of idly sitting around as a trophy of sorts. It's a signal.
    When the enemy is near it's best to let them know you are prepared.</p>
<p>As any great strategist would humbly say, there are no winners in war. Rune
  knows this well.</p><p>However,</p><p>The powers that be have decided today
 there would be war. The cannon was prepared. The enemy was not.</p>
<p>A blast so powerful from the rear of the domain that even the slightest of
  hearing could hear the rumble which briefly terrorized
  the demizens of the central plane today.</p>
  <p>Rune knew he was heard. Rune knew the rest of the kingdom understood it was
him.</p>
<p>Luna awoke to a buzz in the space of her dreams.</p>
<p>This is how they first became acquainted.</p>

<h2>You were promised stories about prostitutes</h2>
<h3>and I don't have any</h3>
<p>However,</p>
<p>My ex-somethingorother deserves a mention. This woman was tits-up insane. She had my balls in a god damn vice for a fuckin' decade and then disappears entirely out of my life suddenly and without explanation only to appear on the internet doing unspeakable things to my friends behind my back.</p>
<p>I'm unsure of how to deal with this, other than tell the truth about it. This website will be my outlet while I finally recover.</p>
<p>I swear to God I've been such a cuck that I've had to figure this shit out by myself and it's a god damn mindfuck to realize how fucked up I've become as a result of it.</p>
<p>It was sick. An abusive relationship that only existed in practice and not in the way we would see things. It was without a premise other than friendship.</p>
<p>As beautiful as that actually is while disregarding my exaggerations, it was also quite damaging to the two of us. I enforced her control, and she enforced my submission.</p>
<p>We were smart. We were sharp at the tongue. We were passionate. We were ambitious.</p>
<p>And we were bullied.</p>
<p>I guess she couldn't take it.</p>
<p>I intend to. I guess I'm there.</p>
<p>Some confessions would have been really helpful to our therapy.</p>
<p>But I know now; it was with a friend, and it was behind my back. You can't show up and say oops.</p>
<p>I hope you recover soon, my friend. I didn't mean to be as much of a victim as I have been.</p>
<p>I guess I'll never hear from you again.</p>
