<h1>The Cannon</h1>
<p>Rune has a cannon. Well okay, he had his dad buy a canon on an auction
  originally intended as a joke that turned into a paperwork mission for permission
  to handle salute weaponry. It's a small, but handy canon. You know, in case
  the castle gets invaded or something.</p>
  <p>To confuse the enemy, Rune enjoys inadvertently causing the canon to
    go boom instead of idly sitting around as a trophy of sorts. It's a signal.
    When the enemy is near it's best to let them know you are prepared.</p>
<p>As any great strategist would humbly say, there are no winners in war. Rune
  knows this well.</p><p>However,</p><p>The powers that be have decided today
 there would be war. The cannon was prepared. The enemy was not.</p>
<p>A blast so powerful from the rear of the domain that even the slightest of
  hearing could hear the rumble terrorized the demizens of the central plane today.</p>
  <p>Rune knew he was heard. Rune knew the rest of the kingdom understood it was
him.</p>
<p>Luna awoke to a buzz in the space of her dreams.</p>
<p>This is how they first became acquainted.</p>
