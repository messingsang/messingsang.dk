<h1>That one time I cucked myself to get her attention</h1>
<p>There is one thing you need to understand about me regarding this website. It's why I don't like kids on here.</p>
<p>I am literally a <strike>fucking</strike> lunatic. I think a fuckton, and my thoughts are <b>fucked up.</b> I put in <b>fuckton of effort</b> to act normal on a daily basis. It sucks, but I am no longer ashamed of this as much as many would have me be.</p>
<p>Please allow me to be myself in this domain.</p>
<p>I am currently reducing my medication for schizophrenia because the experience of being on it sucks hairy sweaty meaty balls.</p>
<p>It takes a long time. It's an ongoing process. I look forward to being recovered from it.</p>
<p>I sometimes write shit on here that's just plain and simple entirely out of whack.</p>
<p>It comes with the territory, and I would apologize if it were my fault.</p>
<p>But I don't want forgiveness. I want you to read what I write as an <a href="javascript:void()" title="for you, because I love you" id="hiddenlink">artwork,<\a> as it is expressed.</p>
<p>I'd also like you to trust me. I'm thankfully not a violent man in any kind of way.</p>
<p>I'm actually quite nice. Gimme a call if you dare.</p>
