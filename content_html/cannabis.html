<h1>Cannabis and antipsychotics</h1>
<h2>Weed is awesome</h2>
<p>Antipsychotics, the pharmaceutics industry, and the psychiatric faction each has the same conspiracy of idiocy within it.</p>
<p>To be on antipsychotics is a waste of life. There is no argument in favor of such punishment.</p>
<p>Cannabis is the only jailbreak. When you've been wrongfully incarcerated and persecuted by the very people who believe it is their intent to help you, life becomes difficult.</p>
<p>When will we learn?</p>

<h2>Wanna talk about it?</h2>
<p>Why don't you give me a call and I'll do my best to guide
  you through it. I am not a professional and I'll probably just give you
  instructions on how to bake a brownie, but I'm a good listener and I'll hear
    out your shit. It's +45 HAILRUNE. That's a standard phone number.</p>
<h3>Rules</h3>
  <p>1. Entirely standard calling rates apply, check with your provider.</p>
    <p>2. Mind the timezone please.</p>
<p>3. If you try to sell me anything I report you to Google. No spam please.</p>
