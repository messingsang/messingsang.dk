<h2 onload="bgchange('weed');">A story on how I became a cannabis enthusiast</h2>

<p>It was a long time ago. I was nineteen or so. I used to say smoking should be illegal because it is inherently bad for you. I have changed since.</p>

<p>I decided to try, not out of pure curiosity but also out of self-destruction. I started liking it. It made me think, and boy did I like thinking.</p>

<p>In particular, it made me think of the plant in terms of its relationship with society. This plant is illegal. Studying it is illegal. This plant's potential medicinal benefits were at that time and still are being politically blocked from being rediscovered by our modern society. That's a prohibition. I was fascinated by it.</p>

<p>The thought ceased when I had a psychotic break from having to leave my beloved playground environment. I spent 15 years without my weed, and in remorse about what I had lost. I took everything out on myself, until I almost died. I had a near-death experience after slowly driving myself to an unhealthy body, and an unhealthy mind.</p>

<p>It changed my life. I started thinking again. I desired the thoughts that once inspired me. I started smoking cannabis again. I felt alive again.</p>

<p>And along comes the reality that I'm thirty five, spent the most of my life without the self care I needed to stay alive, and without allowing myself the love that I needed to actually live. Damn. What a waste of life I felt like, as though I had been released from prison.</p>

<p>I had a lot of shit to go through. I did. Now I'm looking for a stable job from the bottom up, looking at my friends as though their successes in life are an insult to my being. They aren't, but that is; the likes and comments addiction that many display. Facebook was once my reality.</p>

<p>I am currently reducing my presence on social media. I have left invitations to keep in touch via other and more personal means. It would mean a lot to anyone that wakes up in a similar manner, and I know this by empathy.</p>

<p>And if that's what cannabis allows me to realize, and if that's what ends up taking me down this direction I am currently on, then that is medicine.</p>
