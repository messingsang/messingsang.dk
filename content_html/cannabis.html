<h1>Cannabis</h1>
<h2>Weed is awesome</h2>
<p>A carefully controlled dose of nature's finest is good for the brain. I know
  this empirically, and it is my professional opinion as a qualified weedsmoker.
  </p><p>Cannabis is tricky to engage with from a scientific perspective. You
    can scan the brain, you can make behavioral observations, you could even
    convince yourself that you're clairvoyant and then make up a bunch of mumbo
    jumbo about what it does to you, but the effects, which is to say both the
    desirably pleasant experiences and the undersirable consequences that follow,
    exist in the domain of the mind only, and that is personal.</p>
    <p>It's how you handle it.</p>
    <p>Don't ever let anyone tell you it's evil. It has helped me a lot.</p>
    <p>The prohibition is a real problem for people like me. I intend to fight
      it.</p><p>I am a lawful person by default.</p>
      <p>However,</p>
      <p>When the law is mind-bogglingly retarded, it becomes my civil duty as a responsible
        citizen to break it. This is why I am not afraid.</p>
        <p>It's also why I have a great story about calling the non-emergency
          police line to ask <a href="javascript:void(0)" id="hiddenlink" title="and whether I could have some">what
            they actually do with confiscated weed</a>. They were nice enough
            to send me a recording of the conversation. I might upload it
            at some point. </p>
        <p>Anyway cannabis is the most stigmatized medicine [at least when it comes to
          drugs I can personally regard as medicine] that I know of
          and have tried. It's actually
          a privilege to need it in the sense that I enjoy breaking the law
          while maintaining a healthy sense of moral superiority. It's great.</p>

<p>So won't you join me and light up a [small] spliff?</p>

<p>Keep it in balance; psychosis sucks. Take responsibility.</p>

<h2>A story on how I became a cannabis enthusiast</h2>

<p>It was a long time ago. I was nineteen or so. I used to say smoking should be illegal because it is inherently bad for you. I have changed since.</p>

<p>I decided to try, not out of pure curiosity but also out of self-destruction. I started liking it. It made me think, and boy did I like thinking.</p>

<p>In particular, it made me think of the plant in terms of its relationship with society. This plant is illegal. Studying it is illegal. This plant's potential medicinal benefits were at that time and still are being politically blocked from being rediscovered by our modern society. That's a prohibition. I was fascinated by it.</p>

<p>The thought ceased when I had a psychotic break from having to leave my beloved playground environment. I spent 15 years without my weed, and in remorse about what I had lost. I took everything out on myself, until I almost died. I had a near-death experience after slowly driving myself to an unhealthy body, and an unhealthy mind.</p>

<p>It changed my life. I started thinking again. I desired the thoughts that once inspired me. I started smoking cannabis again. I felt alive again.</p>

<p>And along comes the reality that I'm thirty five, spent the most of my life without the self care I needed to stay alive, and without allowing myself the love that I needed to actually live. Damn. What a waste of life I felt like, as though I had been released from prison.</p>

<p>I had a lot of shit to go through. I did. Now I'm looking for a stable job from the bottom up, looking at my friends as though their successes in life are an insult to my being. They aren't, but that is; the likes and comments addiction that many display. Facebook was once my reality.</p>

<p>I am currently reducing my presence on social media. I have left invitations to keep in touch via other and more personal means. It would mean a lot to anyone that wakes up in a similar manner, and I know this by empathy.</p>

<p>And if that's what cannabis allows me to realize, and if that's what ends up taking me down this direction I am currently on, then that is medicine.</p>
