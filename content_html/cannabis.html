<h1>Cannabis</h1>
<h2>Weed was awesome</h2>
<p>I used to have a relationship with that plant.</p>
<p>It was beautiful, and I saw what Mary Jane was for.</p>
<p>She punishes harshly. The trick, like any relationship is to go through, be thankful, and move on.</p>
<p>Cannabis is a drug and a gift and/or curse from God depending on how you handle it.</p>
<p>It's also prohibited for a reason.</p>
<br><br><br>

<h2>Wanna talk about it?</h2>
<p>Why don't you give me a call and I'll do my best to guide
  you through it. I am not a professional and I'll probably just give you
  instructions on how to bake a brownie, but I'm a good listener and I'll hear
    out your shit. It's +45 HAILRUNE. That's a standard phone number.</p>
<h3>Rules</h3>
  <p>1. Entirely standard calling rates apply, check with your provider.</p>
    <p>2. Mind the timezone please.</p>
<p>3. If you try to sell me anything I report you to Google. Hail Google.</p>
