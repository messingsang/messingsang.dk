<i>Let's do an interview</i>
<h3>What the fuck?</h3>
<p>Yeah I'm building an open source website at my own pace in a darn text editor from scratch. I like this hobby.</p>
<h3>Okay so why a website in English under a .dk domain?</h3>
<p>We live here. Rune is on a special mission, and Emil pretty much just does whatever. Don't ask, don't tell.</p>
<h3>Seriously, why Denmark?</h3>
<p>The socioeconomic system is desirable, cannabis prohibition isn't too bad, and the government is generous in many ways.</p>
<h3>Why can't you go home on your website?</h3>
<p>It's an analogy. Think about it.</p>
<h3>Why not use Wordpress?</h3>
<p>That's not funny.</p>
<h3>Are you several people at once?</h3>
<p>Yes, with one body</p>
<h3>Is it really necessary for you to come up with these questions that aren't really relevant?</h3>
<p>Yes. Filler material is important when designing a website, especially when you're doing
  it in raw text. If I actually have something you need to know, I'll replace it later.</p>
<h3>What is TRS?</h3>
<p>Some people say it doesn't exist. It doesn't. It's about the experience of looking at it.</p>
