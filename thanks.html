<h1>List of thankyous and acknowledgements</h1>
<p><a href="https://github.com">Github</a> and all affiliated linux icons for
hosting this <strike>piece of shit</strike> totally awesome website. I swear to
God these guys are completely insane for offering such a powerful service without
even charging for it. Seriously. The DNS host  in Denmark that points here costs
more than the actual web host. (<A href="https://dandomain.dk">They</a> gave me a pretty decent deal) That's crazy. Thanks people.</p>
<p>The people behind <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>.
  This hasn't been implemented (yet) but I've playing around with it and
getting inspired a bit. 
I'm still set on doing everything from scratch, buy it looks promising 
in the sense that it generates a perfectly good basis to do everything 
I need without a vm,
database, php, or CMS. Nice and clean.</p>
  <p>The developers of the <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom text editor</a>.
    It's my favorite.</p>
<p>I'd especially like to thank myself, for being oldschool enough to do
  <em>everything from scratch in raw code.</em></p>
  <p>Okay last but not least, thank <em>you</em> for taking precious time out
    of your everyday life to visit my weird website.</p>
