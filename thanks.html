<h1>List of thankyous and acknowledgements</h1>
<p><a href="https://github.com">Github</a> and all affiliated linux icons for
hosting this piece of shit website. I swear to God these guys are completely
insane for offering such a powerful service without even charging for it.
Seriously. The damn DNS in Denmark that points here costs more than the actual
host. That's crazy. Thanks people.</p>
<p>The people behind the <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll Ruby Project</a>.
  This hasn't been implemented yet but I'm playing around with it a bit.</p>
<p>I'd especially like to thank myself, for being oldschool enough to do
  <em>everything from scratch in raw code.</em></p>
